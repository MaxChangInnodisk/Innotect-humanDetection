"""tracker_demo.py

This code explain the concept behind tracker in easiest way, 
so the performance and code style might not clean as you expected.

KEYWORD: nested loops, Python, OpenCV, object detection

Last but not least, big thank to my mentor MaxChang during internship\

Feel free if you have any question to ask :)
